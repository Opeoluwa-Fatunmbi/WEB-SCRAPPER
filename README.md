# WEB-SCRAPPER

In this script, the requests library is used to send a request to the URL and get the response.
The BeautifulSoup library is used to parse the HTML content of the page and find the data to scrape.
The data is stored in a list and then written to a CSV file using the csv library.

Note that this is a basic example, and the actual implementation will depend on the specific website you want to scrape and the data you want to extract.
You may need to modify the script to match the structure of the website and the specific data you want to scrape.
